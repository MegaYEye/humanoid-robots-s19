# Homework
Homework for [COMSW6731 Humanoid Robots (SP19)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/S19/) at Columbia University (Instructor: [Prof. Peter Allen](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/)).

## Workspace Preparation
You need to have a computer with Ubuntu 14.04/Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Indigo/ROS Kinetics installed (We recommend ROS Indigo + Ubuntu 14.04, and the homework is tested on it).

- ROS Indigo installation link
- ROS Kinetics installation link

You might also want to install many dependencies if in need. Some helper commands can be found in and.

After you have successfully installed Ubuntu and ROS, you should run the following commands to create a workspace
```
mkdir -p ~/homework_ws/src
cd ~/homework_ws/
catkin_make
```
Then, whenever you open a new terminal (unless you add this command to your `bash` file), run
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
